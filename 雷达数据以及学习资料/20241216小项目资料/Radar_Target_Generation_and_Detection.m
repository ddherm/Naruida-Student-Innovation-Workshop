%% Radar Specifications 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Frequency of operation = 77GHz
% Max Range = 200m
% Range Resolution = 1 m
% Max Velocity = 100 m/s
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Declare the variables
Range_max = 200; % in meters
Range_resolution = 1; % in meters
Velocity_max = 100; % in m/s
c = 3e8; %speed of light

%speed of light = 3e8
%% User Defined Range and Velocity of target
% *%TODO* :
% define the target's initial position and velocity. Note : Velocity
% remains contant
 
Target_range = 100; % in meters
Target_velocity = 50; % in m/s

%% FMCW Waveform Generation

% *%TODO* :
%Design the FMCW waveform by giving the specs of each of its parameters.
% Calculate the Bandwidth (B), Chirp Time (Tchirp) and Slope (slope) of the FMCW
% chirp using the requirements above.

%To calculate Bandwidth

B = c / (2 * Range_resolution);

%To find the chirp time
%Sweep time has to ben knowsn and it should be around 5 -6 times the round trip time
Tsweep = 5.5;
Tchirp = Tsweep * (2 * Range_max / c) ;

%To find slope of FMCW
slope = B / Tchirp;

%Operating carrier frequency of Radar

%for Doppler Estimation. 
Nd=128;                   % #of doppler cells OR #of sent periods % number of chirps

%The number of samples on each chirp. 
Nr=512;                  %for length of time OR # of range cells

% Timestamp for running the displacement scenario for every sample on each
% chirp
t=linspace(0,Nd*Tchirp,Nr*Nd); %total time for samples


%Creating the vectors for Tx, Rx and Mix based on the total samples input.

    %For each time stamp update the Range of the Target for constant velocity. 
    range_at_t = 2 * (Target_range + (Target_velocity * t(i)))/c;
    
    % *%TODO* :
    %For each time sample we need to update the transmitted and
    %received signal. 
    Tx(i) = cos(2 * pi * (fc * t(i) + slope * t(i)^2 / 2));
    Rx (i)  = cos(2 * pi * (fc * (t(i) - range_at_t) + slope * (t(i) - range_at_t)^2 / 2));
    
    % *%TODO* :
    %Now by mixing the Transmit and Receive signal, generate the beat signal
    %This is done by element wise matrix multiplication of Transmit and
    %Receiver Signal
    Mix(i) = Tx(i).*Rx(i); % .* is used for elementwise multiplication

%% RANGE MEASUREMENT


 % *%TODO* :
%reshape the vector into Nr*Nd array. Nr and Nd here would also define the size of
%Range and Doppler FFT respectively.
 
% Nr = 1024, Nd = 128
Mix = reshape(Mix, [Nr, Nd]); 

%or
%Mix = reshape (Mix, [Nr, Nd]);

 % *%TODO* :
%run the FFT on the beat signal along the range bins dimension (Nr) and
%normalize.
% *%TODO* :
% Take the absolute value of FFT output

FFT1 = abs(fft(Mix, Nr));

%To Normalize
FFT_Norm = FFT1./max(FFT1); % dividing every element by max value in the 1st FFT output. 

 % *%TODO* :
% Output of FFT is double sided signal, but we are interested in only one side of the spectrum.
% Hence we throw out half of the samples.

FFT_single_side = FFT_Norm(1:Nr/2-1);

%plotting the range

%% RANGE DOPPLER RESPONSE
% The 2D FFT implementation is already provided here. This will run a 2DFFT
% on the mixed signal (beat signal) output and generate a range doppler
% map.You will implement CFAR on the generated RDM


% Range Doppler Map Generation.

% The output of the 2D FFT is an image that has reponse in the range and
% doppler FFT bins. So, it is important to convert the axis from bin sizes
% to range and doppler based on their Max values.

Mix=reshape(Mix,[Nr,Nd]);

% 2D FFT using the FFT size for both dimensions.
sig_fft2 = fft2(Mix,Nr,Nd);

% Taking just one side of signal from Range dimension.
sig_fft2 = sig_fft2(1:Nr/2,1:Nd);
sig_fft2 = fftshift (sig_fft2);
RDM = abs(sig_fft2);
RDM = 10*log10(RDM) ;

%use the surf function to plot the output of 2DFFT and to show axis in both
%dimensions

%% CFAR implementation

%Slide Window through the complete Range Doppler Map

% *%TODO* :
%Select the number of Training Cells in both the dimensions.

Tr = 10; % Range dimension
Td = 8; % Doppler dimension

% *%TODO* :
%Select the number of Guard Cells in both dimensions around the Cell under 
%test (CUT) for accurate estimation

Gr = 4; % Range dimension
Gd = 4; % Doppler dimension

% *%TODO* :
% offset the threshold by SNR value in dB

SNR_OFFSET = 14;

%To claculate the number of Gaurd and Training cells
% Remove CUT
Gaurd_N = (2 * Gr + 1) * (2 * Gd + 1) - 1;

% *%TODO* :
% This has been used in the loop
%Create a vector to store noise_level for each iteration on training cells
noise_level = zeros(1,1);


% *%TODO* :
%design a loop such that it slides the CUT across range doppler map by
%giving margins at the edges for Training and Guard Cells.
%For every iteration sum the signal level within all the training
%cells. To sum convert the value from logarithmic to linear using db2pow
%function. Average the summed values for all of the training
%cells used. After averaging convert it back to logarithimic using pow2db.
%Further add the offset to it to determine the threshold. Next, compare the
%signal under CUT with this threshold. If the CUT level > threshold assign
%it a value of 1, else equate it to 0.
